  "I'm Nico, a 18 year old web developer from Austria with a strong passion for building websites. I have been working in webdevelopment for almost 5 years now. My favorite tools are ReactJS for building the front-end and Tailwind CSS for making everything look great and desing the website individual. I love web development because it allows me to create almost anything I can imagine online. Every project is a new adventure and a chance to learn something new. I'm excited to share my projects with you and explore what's possible together in the world of web development!";

  "I live in the area of Korneuburg in Lower Austria. I've been interested in coding since I was a teenager, which led me to study Information Technology at HTL Hollabrunn. I quickly discovered that web development is my passion — I love using my creativity to build new projects. Right now, I'm working hard on a big project called 'VinoVenture' for my diploma, but I will graduate from HTL Hollabrunn with my Matura in June 2025. I’m really excited to start working as a web developer after I finish school, as I am eager to apply what I've learned and start new projects. Besides coding, I'm also passionate about music. I have been producing my own music for two years and DJing for three. Traveling is another big interest of mine. I enjoy seeing how people live in different parts of the world and I can't wait to go on my next trip!";
